# Unity-Learning-Journey
Unity learning repository containing mini-projects, scripts, and experiments while exploring game development concepts like physics, animation, UI, environment design, and multiplayer setup.


# Unity Terrain Project
This repository contains a Unity terrain project that showcases a basic 3D environment with sculpted terrain, textures, and natural elements.
> The complete Unity project is not uploaded due to its large size.  
> A preview image of the terrain is included below.  
> I will upload all my Unity work in this folder gradually.

## Project Overview
- Created using Unity
- Features sculpted terrain with applied textures
- Includes basic natural elements (trees, hills, etc.)
- Made with Unity Terrain Tools

Currently, I am developing Shadow Tap, a fast-paced 2D reaction game in Unity programmed with C#. In this game, characters quickly appear and disappear between shadows, and the player must tap only when a character is fully visible in the light to score points. Tapping at the wrong time reduces the score, and the game gets faster as it goes, making it more challenging and engaging.
